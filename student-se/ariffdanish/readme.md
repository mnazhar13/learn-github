## Hi there! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drshahizan/drshahizan/master/img/wave.gif" width="30">

I am  __Ariff Danish__, and I am studying at [Universiti Teknologi Malaysia](https://www.utm.my).

I am currently a first-year computer science student ( Data engineering ). Until now, I've learned about the high-level programming language C++. In addition, I participate regularly in sports at UTM. I play for UTM's hockey and floorball teams. I decided on the science computer course since my sister encouraged me to enrol. I'm hoping that my future endeavours in computer science will be simpler and more fruitful.
